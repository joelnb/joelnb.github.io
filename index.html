  			<p class="lead">This is just a simple website to provide some information about who I am and how to contact me. I am a Computer Science graduate with first-class honours from the <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk">University of Birmingham</a> with interests focussing on security, privacy and the intersection of technology and intellectual property laws.</p>
      		<p>At university I have completed modules covering a large number of technologies including Haskell, Java, C/C++, SQL and Matlab, meaning I am familiar with a number of different programming styles and design patterns. My final year project was based around the idea of keyboard emanations which has been previously explored by Asonov &amp; Agrawal in their paper '<a href="http://rakesh.agrawal-family.com/papers/ssp04kba.pdf">Keyboard Acoustic Emanations</a>' and a number of other researchers in later papers. This involved working with different signal processing techniques attempting to separate useful data from the noise in accelerometer data.</p>
  			<p>Before university I studied at <a href="http://www.kingdown.wilts.sch.uk/">Kingdown School</a> where I acheived A-levels in Maths, Physics and German.</p>
